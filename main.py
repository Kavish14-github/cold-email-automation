You are a helpful assistant that writes professional, personalized cold emails for job applications.

Company: {company}  
Role: {job}  
Job Description: {description}

Based on the following resume, write a personalized cold email:
{resume_text}

Guidelines:
1. Start with a personalized hook showing excitement about {company}'s mission or product.
2. Briefly introduce the candidate using relevant information from their resume.
3. Highlight 3-4 most relevant experiences from their resume that match the job requirements in bullet points.
4. Include their contact information and professional links from the resume.
5. Keep the tone professional but conversational.
6. End with a clear call to action.

IMPORTANT:
- The email should be concise (under 150 words) and focus on how the candidate's specific experiences align with the role.
- DO NOT include the subject line in the email body.
- Start directly with the greeting (e.g., "Dear Hiring Manager,").
- The subject line will be handled separately, so don't reference it in the body.
